## Rmarkdown

A really useful way to organize, store and present your workflow: the steps that you take in a data analysis project - from input, to analysis, to presentation

# syntax 
* headings
* fonts
* equations
* inserting images
* R code
* linking to website
* outputing to different formats



# Rmarkdown

## What is Rmarkdown?

Rmarkdown = R + markdown

- _**input**_ simple text:
    - **markdown**: simple formatting of text (bold, links, headers, images, ...)
    - **R**: execute chunks of code (figures, tables...)
    
- _**output**_ various formats:
    - **html**: share on public website
    - **pdf**: polished publication
    - **docx**: share with co-authors to track changes


## Create a R markdown file

In RStudio, to menu File > New File > Rmarkdown... 

Document, HTML. Knit HMTL button to render the right.


## Markdown

"easy" HTML
## Imbed Images

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/rmd_markdownOverview.png" height=400>
</div>


Github renders (with [flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)), eg README.md

## R in Rmarkdown - Chunk

Surround code with 3 backticks with `{r}` in first line

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/markdownChunk.png" height=550>
</div>

## R in Rmarkdown - Inline

Surround code in single backticks

``pi=`r '\x60r pi\x60'` `` evaluates to "pi=`r pi`"

## Equations in Rmarkdown - Chunk

Uses [Latex](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) markup language for equations as input. Outputs using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) JavaScript library for HTML output, native for PDF.

```
$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}
$$
```

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}
$$

## Equations in Rmarkdown - Inline

  ```
  The Arithmetic mean is equal to $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$, or the summation of n numbers divided by n.
  ```

The Arithmetic mean is equal to $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$, or the summation of n numbers divided by n.


## Github Friendly

- Rmarkdown (\*.Rmd) renders as markdown (*.md)
  
- easy to see change in simple text files (vs binary / proprietary formats)



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


cc = function(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, b=0.5, optT=24, Tair) {
  
  airm = exp(-b*(Tair-optT))
  cc = gmax * LAI * airm
  cc
}
cc(Tair=24)

optT = seq(from=15,to=24)
T = seq(from=1, to=20, by=0.5)

cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, optT=24, Tair=T)

res=data.frame(Tair=T)
res$cc = cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, Tair=res$Tair)
plot(res$Tair, res$cc, ylab="Conductance (m/s)",xlab="Air Temperature (C)")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Assigment

Given a climate data set, do the following tasks and document your work in an R-markdown document and store it in your repository- add the name of the repository to gauchospace

 _Tasks_

* graph precipitation and temperature by month, using a box plot
* find wettest and driest years
* add two pictures to illustrate what a wet and dry year might look like for the ecosystem of your choice
* create a new variable that is 1 when its spring, and 2 when its summer, 3 with its fall and 4 when its winter (eg. split your year in to 4, 3 month periods)
* find wettest and driest seasons
* graph the relationship between winter precipitation and summer temperature 
* add some text to describe the graph and comment on why this might be useful to look at
* make at least one edit to your file and commit
changes
* make sure your work includes code, headings
* output your work to a presentation and to a pdf
