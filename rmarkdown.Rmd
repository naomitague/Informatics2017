# Rmarkdown

A really useful way to organize, store and present your workflow: the steps that you take in a data analysis project - from input, to analysis, to presentation

# Functionality (can include)
* text
*   headings
*   fonts
* equations
* images
* R code
* other code
* links to website
* output to different formats


# Create a R markdown file

In RStudio, to menu File > New File > Rmarkdown... 

 Knit HMTL button to render 


# Syntax

Write a simple sentance in your R markdown file  
>Now add some flare to it

Try ` **making text bold ** `
which should look like this

  **making text bold**

or ` _ ** a combinination ** of different fonts _ `

that should look like this 

 _**a combinination** of different fonts_

use a _backtick_ \` to have something not render

More on Rmarkdown [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#styling-text)

Try rendering with _Knit_

Note if things don't look right - a common problem is not putting a space between line
so RMarkdown doesnt' know you are on to a new thing - so try adding a return

# Images

Pay attention to the path name -R is starting with in your working directory

# Links

you can use '[]' to name and link

# Equations in Rmarkdown - Chunk


Surrount your math in **$** symbols

Uses [Latex](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) markup language for equations as input. 

Some nice examples of commonly used greek symbols and functions
[more latex](http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/m343/F12/RStudio/LatexExamples.html)


$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}
$$

this came from
`
$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}
$$
`

# Including R code

You can also include R code:
Use backticks, r, and then give your code _chunk_ a name

```{r conductance, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}


cc = function(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, b=0.5, optT=24, Tair) {
  
  airm = exp(-b*(Tair-optT))
  cc = gmax * LAI * airm
  cc
}
cc(Tair=24)

optT = seq(from=15,to=24)
T = seq(from=1, to=20, by=0.5)

cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, optT=24, Tair=T)

res=data.frame(Tair=T)
res$cc = cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, Tair=res$Tair)
plot(res$Tair, res$cc, ylab="Conductance (m/s)",xlab="Air Temperature (C)")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot
Try playing with echo=TRUE and eval=FALSE

# inline R code

Simple inline R code is also possible, use backticks and starting code  with r
Lets say you want to evaluate something in line the circumference of a circle is $\pi$ times R**2 

* for a radius of 4 we get `r pi*4**2`


# Output formats


"easy" HTML

- _**output**_ various formats:
    - **html**: share on public website
    - **pdf**: polished publication
    - **docx**: share with co-authors to track changes
    - **slidy_presentation** slides
    
- specify this at the top of the R markdown file

- if you add slides (_slidy_presentation_), you can use *** or a header to denote a new slide

- each output format has different options that can also be specified at the top of the R Markdown file
in the **output:** section

# Some Helpful R functions

Ok now lets do some data analysis and communicate results in R
Lets go back to our radiation example

Lets imbedded the code in our R document

```{r sunlight, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
 
sunlight = read.table("sun.txt", header=T)
par(mar=c(5,6,3,2))
boxplot(sunlight$Kdown_direct~sunlight$month,
  ylab="Downwelling Solar\n kj/m2/day",
  xlab="month", col="orange")

```

And lets demo a few useful R functions 

1. _aggregate_
2. _which.max_


```{r moresunlight, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

# total radiation monthly 
sun.mth = aggregate(sunlight, by=list(sunlight$month, sunlight$year), sum)
sun.mth[1:3,]
par(mar=c(5,6,3,2))
boxplot(sun.mth$Kdown_direct~sun.mth$month,
  ylab="Downwelling Solar\n kj/m2/mth",
  xlab="month", col="orange")

# what is the maximum radiation received in any month
result=which.max(sun.mth$Kdown_direct)
sun.mth[result,]

# prettier
sun.mth[result,c("Group.1","Group.2","Kdown_direct")]
# clean up
sun.mth$month=as.integer(sun.mth$Group.1)
sun.mth$year= as.integer(sun.mth$Group.2)
sun.mth[result,c("month","year","Kdown_direct")]

# and then maybe find average values
sun.avg = aggregate(sun.mth, by=list(sun.mth$month), mean)
sun.avg[1:3,]

barplot(sun.avg$Kdown_direct, names=sun.avg$Group.1, ylab="Mean Monthly Solar Radiation")

```

# Assigment

Given a climate data set, do the following tasks and document your work in an R-markdown document and store it in your repository- add the name of the repository to gauchospace

 _Tasks_

* graph precipitation and temperature by month, using a box plot
* find wettest and driest years
* add two pictures to illustrate what a wet and dry year might look like for the ecosystem of your choice
* create a new variable that is 1 when its spring, and 2 when its summer, 3 with its fall and 4 when its winter (eg. split your year in to 4, 3 month periods)
* find wettest and driest seasons
* graph the relationship between winter precipitation and summer temperature 
* add some text to describe the graph and comment on why this might be useful to look at
* make at least one edit to your file and commit
changes
* make sure your work includes code, headings
* output your work  to a pdf and then to slides
